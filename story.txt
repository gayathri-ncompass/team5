In her dream she is fourteen, running home from work on precarious little heels, 
down the paved street, as molten metal plip-plops around her, dotting the cement
with perfect silver discs. Her mother lags six feet behind, following her footsteps, 
urging her to tread carefully. A V2 rocket launches overhead, triggering the timer 
in her mind. She waits in the signature silence for the rocket to find its mark, 
as it careens noiselessly through the night sky.
