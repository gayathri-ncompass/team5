In her dream she is fourteen, running home from work on precarious little heels, 
down the paved street, as molten metal plip-plops around her, dotting the cement
with perfect silver discs. Her mother lags six feet behind, following her footsteps, 
urging her to tread carefully. A V2 rocket launches overhead, triggering the timer 
in her mind. She waits in the signature silence for the rocket to find its mark, 
as it careens noiselessly through the night sky.

“One,” she shouts, “Two. Three. Four.”

“We have plenty of time, Lizzy, plenty of time.” Her mother is shouting, over and over, no panic, just a calm, reassuring scream.

It is the same dream as always. Lizzy reaches behind and grabs the older woman’s hand, pulls her into the shelter of their porch, watching as the house across the road explodes into a heap of searing, flaming rubble.
